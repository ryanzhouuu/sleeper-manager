# Opening-week projection candidate

The version-one candidate is independent of the active `direct_baseline` advisor.
Its engineering defaults are explicit and model-versioned in `HybridProjectionConfig`.
They are not fitted coefficients or a claim of predictive calibration.

`HybridHistory` separates joint played-game stat evidence from census-derived
`ParticipationOpportunity` records. `JointGameObservation.verified_fields` must come
from source coverage checks: normalized zero values do not establish field presence.
Unresolved identities or outcomes are gaps, not automatic rookie classifications or DNPs.

`HybridHistoryPools` prepares profiles for a cutoff, target season, and scoring policy.
It uses 14-day current-season recency, caps previous-season influence at six games
and older-season influence at three, and adds a five-game donor prior. Donors are
up to 20 other players with at least 10 verified played games, ordered by standardized
seven-stat profile distance and stable player identity. Five donors are required for
pooling; sufficient own history can stand alone. All joint stat lines remain intact.
Uncovered games are exposed through `excluded_games` rather than inferred as zero stats.
